<h2>A little about myself</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to my little corner of the world, as you may have guessed my name is Ray Davidson and I am currently studying for a diploma in Information Technology at the RMIT University as well as working part time as a fabricator making trailers for a local Brisbane manufacturer.</br>
<p>My student number is s3885707</br>
<p>My student email address is <a href="mailto:s3885707@student.rmit.edu.au">s3885707@student.rmit.edu.au</a> if you wish to contact me.</br>
<p>I was born in Nambour Queensland but have lived in a few places throughout my years. For most of my dwellings around this beautiful country I was under the age of 20 and varied from Darwin down to Sydney. I was a city boy and a country boy all in one, I learned various skill like hunting and horse riding from the country and was able to learn metal fabrication and motor mechanics from my time in the city.</br> 
<p>Yet one common denominator remained with me through out my life and that was learning how things worked. I was in my happiest when I was pulling something electronic apart to see how it worked and if I could use it for something else it wasn’t designed to do. That was what sparked my interest in technology and from that my keen interest in computers and what they could do. My most rememberable construction was pulling apart my VIC-20 (early model commodore 64) and creating a joystick with wires soldered to the main-board and then wrapped around metal knives and spoons to make the contacts for up, down, left, right and fire.</br>
<p>Since then I have branched out Started an apprenticeship in boiler-making obtained my heavy rigid truck licence, unrestricted forklift licence, sheet metal work, certificate 4 in CNC lathe and milling and dabbled in three phase motors and machinery repairs with becoming a maintenance worker.<br>
<p>Unfortunately I never followed through with my interest in computers and technology professionally except for when I was 16 years old and was able to get a job in Sydney as a junior computer engineer with a company called Solution 6 which only lasted about 6 months. My job was to assist the head engineers with fixing in house hardware and software issues within the multistory building and going on site to help fix problems with customer’s computers whether it be hardware or software.I really enjoy fixing all sorts of things but especially technology such as computer systems and the likes. So with the completion of my diploma I can finally have the qualification follow my dream job and career. My introduction to that side of technology is what my goal is even now several years later which is to become a computer repair field technician such as the job listed below.</br>

<h2>My Project Idea</h2>
</br>
</br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
For my project idea I have decided on making a simple but helpful mobile phone app for the placement of gas rams or gas struts which are one in the same thing just different names. It will be comprised of the strut lengths, strut gas pressure, door weights, and the recommended distance for attaching each end of the strut for each job required.
</br>
</br>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
My motivation for this app is to help fabricators like myself to be able to quickly and efficiently be able to work out the gas strut force and the gas strut positioning easily without the need to have to look up the required documents each time someone fits out the gas struts on which ever project they are working on at the time.
</br>
</br>
<h3>Description</h3>
My app that I would like to create will have all the formula embedded with in the program so the user only has to find which unknown they are looking for whether it be the gas strut force or the positioning of each end of the strut . It will have a graphical layout with a simple interface of a picture of the strut with all the information that is a variable will be blank and waiting for the user to input the desired amount or condition. The blank information will be the gas strut length as they come in many sizes, the gas strut force which is a requiem for opening the door or moving part on the project to desired height or angle. The door weight will also be needed to be inputted into the required blank spot as well as the angle or position that the door is required to open to. Once the user has inputted all the correct data my app will then display the correct placement and or the correct gas strut force needed to complete the said project or job they are working on at the time. All the formula needed for this app can be found online and is readily available to be inputted into my program.
