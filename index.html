<h1>Welcome to the world of Ray Davidson</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my little corner of the world, as you may have guessed my name is Ray Davidson and I am currently studying for a diploma in Information Technology at the RMIT University as well as working part time as a fabricator making trailers for a local Brisbane manufacturer . My student number is s3885707 and my student email address is s3885707@student.rmit.edu.au if you wish to contact me.</br>
<p>I was born in Nambour Queensland but have lived in a few places throughout my years. For most of my dwellings around this beautiful country I was under the age of 20 and varied from Darwin down to Sydney. I was a city boy and a country boy all in one, I learned various skill like hunting and horse riding from the country and was able to learn metal fabrication and motor mechanics from my time in the city.</br> 
<p>Yet one common denominator remained with me through out my life and that was learning how things worked. I was in my happiest when I was pulling something electronic apart to see how it worked and if I could use it for something else it wasn’t designed to do. That was what sparked my interest in technology and from that my keen interest in computers and what they could do. My most rememberable construction was pulling apart my VIC-20 (early model commodore 64) and creating a joystick with wires soldered to the main-board and then wrapped around metal knives and spoons to make the contacts for up, down, left, right and fire.</br>
<p>Since then I have branched out Started an apprenticeship in boiler-making obtained my heavy rigid truck licence, unrestricted forklift licence, sheet metal work, certificate 4 in CNC lathe and milling and dabbled in three phase motors and machinery repairs with becoming a maintenance worker.<br>
<p>Unfortunately I never followed through with my interest in computers and technology professionally except for when I was 16 years old and was able to get a job in Sydney as a junior computer engineer with a company called Solution 6 which only lasted about 6 months. My job was to assist the head engineers with fixing in house hardware and software issues within the multistory building and going on site to help fix problems with customer’s computers whether it be hardware or software.I really enjoy fixing all sorts of things but especially technology such as computer systems and the likes. So with the completion of my diploma I can finally have the qualification follow my dream job and career. My introduction to that side of technology is what my goal is even now several years later which is to become a computer repair field technician such as the job listed below.</br>
